## Sorter

I created sorter as an exercise to refresh my memory of sorting algorithms, to help understand how the algorithms worked I wanted to visualise them in action. The app takes an input array and sorts it from smallest to largest. You can view sorter here: https://darraghobrien.com/projects/sorter

### Running Locally

Sorter is a react app, to run locally you will need to have node installed. Clone the project to your machine, run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

### Testing

There are some very basic tests included which I plan to add to. To run the tests run `npm run test`
